Constructive comments:
- The function name "function" is not descriptive and should be changed to something more meaningful.
- There are no input parameter types specified, it would be beneficial to add type hints to make the function's inputs clearer.
- The return statement does not have any error handling in case x or y are not valid inputs. It would be good to add some form of error checking or validation.
- It is generally considered good practice to add comments to explain the purpose of the function and any key steps within it.

Positive Feedback:
- The function is short and concise, which is generally a good practice.
- The mathematical exponentiation using the double asterisk operator is a valid approach and does not need to be changed.
- The code follows Python's standard indentation style.

Overall, the code is relatively simple and does not require major changes. However, the function name, input parameter types, error handling, and comments should be improved for better readability and maintainability.
