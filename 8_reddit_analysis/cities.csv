k2qpp53,NYC,16vekjs,,"It's not a sewer and it's not sewage coming out. Lower Manhattan has underground steam pipes which some buildings rely on for heating. If the pipe leaks, or rainwater seeps through the ground and boils on the steam pipe, it creates a lot of hot steam that has nowhere to go but up and out. At high pressure like you see here, the escaping steam is strong enough to carry dirt and rust particles out with it, or lift manhole covers."

k2mu6ye,NYC,16upnsm,,Not sure how long these services are going to last.
k2moq0p,NYC,16upnsm,,When does this go into effect?
k2mlo8b,NYC,16upnsm,,"Good. 

People stop buying so much delivery because prices are higher. 

Uber eats stops existing at that price point. 

Illegally driven scooter disaster over."
k2mqu91,NYC,16upnsm,,"This can go two ways 

1. Uber and DD service will leave NyC.

2. They increase service fee by 2000% on customers to pay for drivers.

Either way, it's a race to the bottom."
k2nbqov,NYC,16upnsm,,"The lawsuit was never about not wanting to pay delivery workers a fair wage. If you read the actual lawsuit filings, you‚Äôll quickly realize that this news article along with others never address the issues brought about in the lawsuit. 

This law is worded so that delivery companies must pay delivery workers when the delivery app is open ‚Äî even if they are intentionally declining deliveries. It‚Äôs absolutely reasonable for companies such as Uber to want stricter criteria here, or else everyone is going to start exploiting this loophole and Uber is going to have to either pull out of the market or ban drivers with poor acceptance rates.

Another main argument was that it‚Äôs unfair that this law is only applicable to food delivery workers and not grocery workers. Instacart just decreased its base driver pay from $7 to $4 per order. While one could argue that the inclusion of this argument in a lawsuit filed by food delivery companies is a mere tactic to delay the law going into effect, the lack of the mention of this in any news article is stunning.

Can anyone find an actual link to the official decision by Justice Moyne?"

k5uty8i,NYC,17d6ip0,,I'm fine with this on principal. It's people's right to protest... but the protests/marches literally a day after the attack started and Israeli civilians were still being killed was just horrendously callous... to put it mildly. I'm sure these are mostly the same people... so F'em.
k5v93s1,NYC,17d6ip0,,"They do know that hamas killed 1000+ random civilians in the name of genocide against Jews, right?"
k5vbcqt,NYC,17d6ip0,,"While watching the Nazis celebrate their election victory by marching through the Brandenburg Gate, impressionist painter Max Liebermann commented: ""Ich kann gar nicht soviel fressen, wie ich kotzen m√∂chte."" (""I could not possibly eat as much as I would like to throw up."").

Hamas wants to kill all Jews, all of them, and for all its flaws, the IDF is the only institution in their way. The people of Gaza elected Hamas. There is no uprising within Gaza against Hamas and no protest. Standing with Gaza is supporting another genocide against Jews.

k25hvav,Seattle,16rvgcf,,You sound like a good person. Appreciate you.
k25ol8b,Seattle,16rvgcf,,I would like to see property management be restricted from all out of state corporations.

A common tactic lately that I've seen: you search a dealer's inventory, with price listed. Then go to dealer, and find that in addition to the main window sticker, there's a second window sticker with thousands of dollars of add-on accessories, plus ""market adjustment"" (since Covid/chip shortage) for a few more thousand. This has happened to me after confirming online price on the phone with a sales person.

I understand how capitalism works; dealers are allowed to charge as much as they want, but it's super frustrating to waste time traveling to the dealer to find out the actual price, which sometimes doesn't happen until once the buying process has started (I've heard many accounts of this happening, surprise add'l fees after being at the dealer for hours)."

I was able to give my over shirt to the team member at  top of the stairs to wrap her up in and had an extra cat carrier that I brought with me just in case of.""

She looks very tired, is covered in fleas and dehydrated. She started eating wet food again which is a good sign but I'll monitor her and take her to the vet as soon as she calms down and stabilizes a bit. I would update again once I hear from the vet.

k34lord,Austin,16xucch,,"AUSTIN (KXAN) ‚Äî Local cat owner Palash Pandey was reunited with his cat, Tux, overnight Sunday into Monday morning after the two were separated following a rideshare trip on Saturday.

Pandey has posted updates on social media throughout his search for Tux.

Pandey told KXAN over the phone that investigators hired by Lyft found Tux about a mile away from where the driver dropped Pandey off, and he was alerted around 1:30 a.m. Monday. He said Tux is back home, ate food and drank water, and will be taken to a vet later Monday.

According to Pandey, he took the trip Saturday to bring his cat in for medical care at a Banfield Pet Hospital location on Research Boulevard in Austin. When they arrived, he exited the vehicle and went around to the other side in order to retrieve Tux‚Äôs carrier.

But before he could, the Lyft driver began to drive away.

‚ÄúI like ran behind him, screaming like ‚Äòwait, wait, wait,‚Äô I banged on his windows hoping that he would notice me and just stop. But instead of that he just like, peeled off, he drove away,‚Äù Pandey said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how else you would perceive somebody who you just dropped off running behind you and banging on your windows and doors. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a charitable explanation for that.‚Äù

Pandey then attempted to contact the driver through the Lyft application, but did not receive a reply before using up the application‚Äôs message limit. He attempted to use Lyft‚Äôs live support but said it was unresponsive.

‚ÄúWe are aware of the situation and we‚Äôre currently in touch with the rider and driver,‚Äù said a Lyft spokesperson in a Sunday afternoon statement to KXAN.

In a statement to KXAN Sunday night, a Lyft spokesperson said they were in touch with Pandey ‚Äúwithin minutes of his initial outreach.‚Äù

> The Consumers Legal Remedies Act makes unlawful certain unfair methods of competition and certain unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by a person in a transaction intended to result or that results in the sale or lease of goods or services to a consumer, including advertising goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised. Existing law authorizes a consumer who suffers damage as a result of the use or employment by a person of a method, act, or practice declared to be unlawful by that provision to bring an action against that person to recover or obtain certain relief, including actual damages of at least $1,000.

> This bill would, beginning on July 1, 2024, with specified exceptions, additionally make unlawful advertising, displaying, or offering a price for a good or service that does not include all mandatory fees or charges other than taxes or fees imposed by a government on the transaction, as specified. The bill would provide that assessments made pursuant to the California Tourism Marketing Act and the Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989, and business assessments made pursuant to the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994, are fees imposed by a government on the transaction for purposes of these provisions.

One of the key changes:

> (29) (A) Advertising, displaying, or offering a price for a good or service that does not include all mandatory fees or charges other than either of the following:

> (i) Taxes or fees imposed by a government on the transaction.

> (ii) Postage or carriage charges that will be reasonably and actually incurred to ship the physical good to the consumer."

Our local hospitals have antivenom and the effects of the bite can take several hours to develop. Pain and cramping are the likeliest symptoms. Nobody has died in the US from a black widow bite since the early 1980s.

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqX4DwIRXZdYRGZGpl0UIxQb3yVk6P-jUZGXilbQvYYUIqiQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqX4DwIRXZdYRGZGpl0UIxQb3yVk6P-jUZGXilbQvYYUIqiQ/viewform)

It opens by telling respondents:

>National Harbor is the Correct Choice For Expanding Metro

Then there are a few paragraphs arguing in favor. And then here's the only question posed:

>There are community forums upcoming and we want to present this data at these hearings.  
>  
>I am in favor of a metro rail station at National Harbor  
>  
>I am opposed to a metro rail station at National Harbor.

Moreover, the ""survey"" was distributed by a local group (backed by area businesses) to its supporters. It included no discussion of alternatives, costs (other than an argument in favor), or other tradeoffs. This is 100% a push poll, designed for advocacy rather than to actually understand what people think about transit policy options.

Reasonable minds can disagree about whether Metro's next expansion should include National Harbor. But this ""survey"" is meaningless."
k1pauza,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"I just wish the northeastern segment could be bumped eastward a little to serve some of the areas the other concepts do (Trinidad, Gallaudet, Starburst, and/or Lincoln Park, etc.)."
k1p8x92,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"Makes no sense to me that the Harbor was developed without Metro extending there. Not that it hasn't been successful, but just seems like a strange oversight considering how close it is."
k1pffui,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,Anything that brings more density and capacity to DC's urban core is good with me. Honestly more important at this point
k1p6jrz,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"Lol, prince George's county residents support extending metro into prince George's county. More at 11."
k1p7z6s,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"Definitely go to National Harbor. That corridor is underserved by transit and I think there are plans for a light rail up from points south of there, so we could complete that rail connection. 

But then take the other end of the Blue Line out Columbia Pike toward Annandale instead of Blooping. 

And then split the Yellow Line off of the Green so there‚Äôs no more interlining. (I think the best option for this is probably routing the Yellow from the Potomac up through the eastern part of downtown to Union Station and through Ivy City, Ft. Lincoln, and Port Towns like Metro has proposed as an option for the Silver Line as an alternative to the Bloop)"
k1pkeku,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"As a guy that used to drive from Waldorf to DC all the time, I would love to one day see the Green line extended to Waldorf and take a bunch of cars off 301/5.  There's a dying mall there with a gigantic parking lot that I think would make for a bang up metro stop, and could drop additional stops all through PG along that corridor.  I hope that the SMRT is able to get through all the political hoops and get built at some point in the coming years."
k1p6t46,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"A loop line is a very good idea, it helps alleviate the lack of express tracks to some extent"
k1psbwf,WashingtonDC,16p7rq3,,"I find these polls kind of useless, to be honest. 

Did the poll say what other metro option are available? Did it say the cost of extending the Metro to National Harbor? Did it compare the cost to other options?"

k4wxcqp,SanDiego,177zfkx,,Right around the time I moved here I was going for a drive at night and I came across this intersection.

k1zkquw,SanDiego,16qq9zy,,I'm glad it's closed. Some people just don't know how to act right and ruin it for everybody. They should have a little privacy and respect and a place of their own since the seals were there before us.

This was a 3 day weekend in November.  There were drunken people climbing over fences and jumping down onto the rocks were the sea lions were trying to nap, taking selfies and trying to pet the sea lions.  The animals would lunge at people trying to drive them back or would dive back into the ocean.  

I have to agree with the ruling.  Humans have plenty of areas to swim in.  I read the academic paper on the matter.  The rocks are just an extension of the marine sanctuary.  

The flat top of the bluffs in the area is a park and there is nice fencing along the edge.  We can stay on the top and watch the animals all we want, kind of watching the sea elephants at Piedras Blancas in central California."

People who requested paper instead of plastic were frowned upon for not caring."

But really the only bad part about it was the need to buy a bunch of canvas bags to ensure that I always had one on hand if needed. It wasn't nearly as inconvenient as I had expected it to be, in actual practice.

Longoria made a nice stab at third but Walker had to do the splits at first on the throw to record the out and Costas calmly said, ‚Äúvery nice play right there.‚Äù It was a legit espn web gem."

k1x604z,Minneapolis,16qi73l,,"Yeah, there are two equally delusional takes and both detract from actually improving the city."
k1xwgvr,Minneapolis,16qi73l,,"I'm sad to say I made the decision to move away from Minneapolis last year due to feeling this way. I moved to St. Paul to feel a bit safer. In 2021 I saw multiple shootouts, had neighbors' cars shot up and bullets enter their homes, several carjackings on my block as well as many catalytic converters stolen on the block. People would also drive 70 miles an hour down residential blocks and run stop signs racing each other for fun. Maybe where I was living saw more heat than other areas, but there WAS an increase in crime, especially since I went to college in the 2010s. I still live with trauma from being on high alert constantly. This sub made it feel like anyone who pointed out that crime had gone up, or that it was actually occurring was an out-of-touch republican from the suburbs. I lived in Minneapolis for 6 years, and for 2 more years before that in college. I have never lived in the suburbs ever, I am liberal, and have never voted for a Republican. The biggest reason I left was not THE CRIME in particular, but because of the way the discussion was so divisive, many of my neighbors had the weirdest take on crime like it wasnt happening, and if it was, it wasn't that bad, and if it was bad, it was the same in every other city due to covid... Sure, that's fine, but why was talk about improving things met with hostility? Me saying we should do more to fight crime was equated with being some pro-police bootlicker who was pro locking more people up. I never said any of those things or felt that way, I just wanted to have a civil constructive discourse with neighbors..."
k1xc14j,Minneapolis,16qi73l,,"I don't understand why more obvious crime isn't prosecuted. In particular, I do not understand why the fentanyl and meth is tolerated. There are people out there who seem to feel like unless a crime involves a victim being physically assaulted, it's a victimless crime that doesn't impact others.

We have 2 young kids and have picked needles and foil out of our front yard. We walk to lunch or the library and there's broken pipes. We wait for the bus and people are smoking or passed out at the bus stop and there's and all kinds of trash strewn everywhere. People getting into a physical fight over drugs on the bus have fallen over onto our stroller with our kid in it. People start dumpsters on fire in our block and are cheered for it. We love this city so much and are trying really hard to do what's right and raise our kids in an urban environment without driving everywhere. The majority of the time, things are great. But some days it is really hard and doubts about whether we are balancing our social responsibility with what's best for our family do creep up. People act like it doesn't matter, but it really does. Most of the people in power either actively resent the core neighborhoods of the city, or zip around in their SUVs with blinders on acting like everything is fine. Complain about anything and you're either accused of pearl clutching or told that's what you get for living in Minneapolis.

There absolutely is a place between racially motivated policing and extreme sentencing for lower-impact crimes, and just doing nothing and letting it happen in the open with no consequences at all. I don't know why more people in power aren't motivated to find that."
k22ybas,Minneapolis,16qi73l,,My car was stolen in summer of 2022 and I was assaulted by four teenagers in April of this past year. There‚Äôs been no accountability for either crime. Fucking sucks.
k1xa6io,Minneapolis,16qi73l,,That sounds like another night in Loring Park and it shouldn't be. I feel like I'm the only one who's upset that the city repainted LaSalle for two car lanes to give drag racers their own lane. 15th also got repainted as is and there's still zero traffic calming on the blocks directly abutting Emerson and the park. Aldrich in Lowry Hill East has more speed humps than all of Loring Park combined. As far as loud aggressive arguments Nicollet Tower getting torn down would go a long way in addressing that.

2. Our original state constitution being one of the more fair ones out there (free black men could vote),

3. How many important federal politicians were from the area or lived here (before the civil war, we had Jackson and a Supreme Court Justice), and

4. (To a lesser extent) The strong sense of civic duty (e.g., militia/military involvement) present in the state.

Several years ago I lost a significant amount of weight. I did it through strict diet and exercise, but my methods were in no way ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.  We are talking the very rapid loss of 90 pounds. During this time I continued eating Green Chile (because you don‚Äôt give up the best), I just switched up my order.  The change in my appearance did not go unnoticed. I think the dad really thought I might be seriously ill. Due to just a little bit of a language and accent issue, I don‚Äôt think I ever fully conveyed that I was just losing weight. He spent real time expressing real concern to me and offering herbal remedies. It sounds kind of funny now, but I was and remain very genuinely touched at the level of concern for my well-being expressed by the man at the Indian restaurant a time when many people who saw me every day later told me they had concerns but said nothing.

A lot of responders to this thread are overlooking the intense complexity of the reality of this situation and way too willing to devolve into right vs wrong when the answer is so much more complex.  At the end of the day we have the UK to blame for this whole debacle because by not effectively governing a territory/protectorate they allowed the Zionist movement to gain momentum and really start the slow burn of this issue.  At the end of the day the people acting out and suffering on both sides are generations removed from the actual issues and there aren't easy answers.  

We all know that this starts before Christ, when the Babylonians conquered Judah and exiled Jews/Israelite to Babylon effectively kicking them out of their homeland.  

2400 years later Zionism encouraged Jews to return to Israel and establish settlements.   It was more or less allowed by the Brits (Balfour Declaration) and that ignited Zionist immigration.  Of course the issue is that the land was already occupied by Arabs/Palestinians.  It really gained a lot of momentum after what took place during WWII.  Jews wanted their own homeland.  It wasn't really problematic when the Jewish settlers were on their own settlements/communes.  But as their population grew larger, political activism grew to petition the British government to give them their own country.  Carve it out of Palestine.  That of course in turn sparked political activism on the Palestinians side who opposed that solution.  It was Palestine, and Palestinians should not have to give up any of it for something that took places thousands of years before.  And make no mistake they were mad.  They rioted and it resulted in deaths.

I have never imagined what a city would be like without public transportation and walkable neighborhoods/commercial districts. Wouldn‚Äôt it be impossible to get around without a car? What should people who advocate low carbon and environmental protection do? What about people who don‚Äôt want to take on a car loan? Until I came to America, to Columbus, it seemed like the answer was that everyone had to drive to any destination. Two large shopping malls are located in cheaper areas, far from the city center. Entertainment venues are spread throughout the city, but the supposedly bustling city center has become boring, filled with apartments and various shops that have closed early. The only place worth visiting at night is Short North, however, for most people you still have to get there by car. Although I have adapted to car life to some extent, I still don‚Äôt find it more convenient/affordable than public transportation. If the city center becomes like this, I will move downtown immediately."

> Abortion until birth? *That's too far!* Vote 'No"" in Issue 1!

and with typical images you expect for things like this - just like a cutaway anatomy image of ready-to-birth fetus in the womb.

And I had not looked into the issues yet but I was like ""that billboard seems...incendiary. Like yeah I don't think that abortion when the forthcoming child would be breathing and yelling is a good thing....but I also don't think that any reasonable person would try to enshrine that into law.""

And I just looked at the actual text of the law. Here's the link: https://www.readtheamendment.com/

It's *specifically* saying that doctors cannot do abortion after 'viability' (with caveats for threats to mother's health/life), and viability is described very well and quite broadly. Here's the plain language summary of the definition:

> \4. As used in this Section, ‚ÄúFetal viability‚Äù means ‚Äúthe point in a pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient‚Äôs treating physician, the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures. This is determined on a case-by-case basis‚Äù; and ‚ÄúState‚Äù includes any governmental entity and political subdivision

That billboard literally just took the ""they're killing babies!"" talking point and made it as anger-inspiring as possible.

What a bunch of assholes."
