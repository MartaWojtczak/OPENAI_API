HOW TO CREATE VIRTUAL ENV TO CONNECT SPOTIFY
commands in the same place where .env file

1. python -m venv env (it creates virtual env)
2. env\Scripts\activate (it activates virtual env)

now you are in virtual environment 

3. install packages (pip install ...)

4. run your script :)

WHY we need VE 

here I use paid features of OpenAi products. That is why everyone who uses script has to provide their own API key. Also, it is connected to Spotify account and it also has to be parametrized. That is why this script has to be configured on local machine using your own APIs.
